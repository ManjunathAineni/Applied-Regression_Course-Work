# ðŸ“Š Applied Regression Using R â€“ Coursework Repository

Welcome to my Applied Regression project repository! This work was completed as part of my graduate coursework in Data Science at Florida State University. All analysis was performed using **R**, with a focus on practical implementation, data exploration, model building, and statistical interpretation.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

The *Applied Regression* course provided hands-on training in regression techniques and model diagnostics. The goal was to build robust statistical models and draw meaningful conclusions from real-world data using R.

- âœ… Multiple Linear Regression
- âœ… Variable Selection (AIC/BIC, Stepwise)
- âœ… Multicollinearity & VIF
- âœ… Residual Analysis & Diagnostic Plots
- âœ… Polynomial & Interaction Terms
- âœ… Data Transformations

## ðŸ“¦ R Packages Used

The following R packages were extensively used throughout the coursework:

| Package       | Purpose                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `ggplot2`     | Data visualization                       |
| `dplyr`       | Data manipulation                        |
| `tidyr`       | Data cleaning and tidying                |
| `car`         | Regression diagnostics (e.g., VIF)       |
| `MASS`        | Stepwise model selection                 |
| `caret`       | Data splitting, resampling, model eval   |
| `readr`       | Reading CSV and text data                |
| `broom`       | Tidying model outputs                    |
| `lmtest`      | Model comparison and hypothesis testing  |
| `e1071`       | Additional ML tools (for logistic models)|
